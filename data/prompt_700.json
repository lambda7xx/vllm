Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Install Rust: To get started, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.\n2. Set up your development environment: You will need to install the Linux kernel headers on your development machine. You can install the headers for your current kernel using the following command:\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n```\n1. Create a new Rust project: Once you have Rust and the kernel headers installed, you can create a new Rust project using the `cargo new` command. For example:\n```sh\ncargo new my_netfilter --bin\n```\n1. Write your code: You will need to write the actual code that implements your netfilter. Rust provides a set of FFI bindings to the Linux kernel, which you can use to interface with the kernel. You will need to use these bindings to register your netfilter hook function with the kernel's netfilter framework. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to register a netfilter hook function using Rust:\n```rust\nuse libc::{c_int, c_uint};\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\nuse std::ptr;\n\n// Define the netfilter hook function\nextern \"C\" fn my_netfilter_hook(\n    skb: *mut c_void,\n    nf_hook_state: *mut nf_hook_state_t\n) -> c_uint {\n    // Your netfilter hook code goes here\n    // ...\n\n    // Accept the packet\n    NF_ACCEPT\n}\n\n// Register the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn init_module() -> c_int {\n    let hook_ops = nf_hook_ops {\n        hook: Some(my_netfilter_hook),\n        hooknum: NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING as u_int8_t,\n        pf: PF_INET as u_int16_t,\n        priority: NF_IP_PRI_FIRST,\n    };\n    let result = unsafe {\n        nf_register_hook(&hook_ops)\n    };\n    if result < 0 {\n        return result as c_int;\n    }\n    0\n}\n\n// Unregister the netfilter hook function\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn cleanup_module() -> c_void {\n    unsafe {\n        nf_unregister_hook(&hook_ops);\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Build your kernel module: Once you have written your code, you can use the `cargo build` command to build your kernel module. This will produce a `.ko` file that you can load into the kernel using the `insmod` command.\n2. Load your kernel module: To load your kernel module, use the `insmod` command. For example:\n```sh\nsudo insmod my_netfilter.ko\n```\n1. Test your netfilter: Once your module is loaded, you can test your netfilter by sending packets through the network interface that your netfilter is hooked to. You can use tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor the packets and verify that your netfilter is working correctly.\n\nNote: Writing kernel modules can be dangerous and may potentially harm your system.

In Python, this is typically achieved by making attributes and methods private using the double underscore (`__`) prefix. Private attributes and methods can only be accessed from within the class itself, not from outside the class.\n\nHere's an example of using encapsulation in a class:\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self.__balance = balance\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.__balance += amount\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount <= self.__balance:\n            self.__balance -= amount\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.__balance\n```\nIn this example, we define a `BankAccount` class with a private `__balance` attribute and public `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods modify the `__balance` attribute, while the `get_balance` method returns its value. Because `__balance` is private, it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n\n#### Polymorphism\n\nPolymorphism is the concept of using the same interface (e.g., method name) to represent different types of objects. In Python, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and duck typing.\n\nHere's an example of using polymorphism in a class:\n```python\nclass Shape:\n    def area(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Rectangle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n\n    def area(self):\n        return self.width * self.height\n\nclass Circle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n    def area(self):\n        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Shape` parent class with an `area` method that raises a `NotImplementedError` exception (since the method should be overridden in child classes). We then define two child classes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`) that inherit from `Shape` and override the `area` method to compute the area of their respective shapes. We can then create objects of both classes and call their `area` methods, even though they have different implementations.\n\n#### Operator Overloading\n\nOperator overloading is the concept of defining special methods in a class to define how the class should behave with built-in Python operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). In Python, operator overloading is achieved by defining methods with special names that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__div__`).\n\nHere's an example of using operator overloading in a class:\n```python\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)\n\n    def __mul__(self, scalar):\n        return Vector(self.x * scalar, self.y * scalar)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Vector` class with `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__str__` methods.

Insist on the Highest Standards: Ensuring Quality Control at Nystar\nS: Nystar", "len": 762}, {"value": "Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson suggest looking in detail at the five steps of this new approach and how each leverages the tool kit for strategy-making under uncertainty.\n\nThe first step is:\n1. Define Extreme but Plausible Scenarios\nCompanies that employ scenario planning attempt to forecast how political, economic, technological, and social conditions may evolve. They then develop best-case, worst-case, and base-case scenarios that are probability weighted to assess strategic moves.\n\nIn our experience, looking at scenarios in that way too often produces incremental thinking\u2014tweaks in a company\u2019s current direction rather than a wholesale change in course, which is often what\u2019s needed. Breakthrough insights come from examining what we call extreme but plausible scenarios. The goal of this analysis is not to understand which outcome is most probable but to uncover new and different ways to compete and win, given a plethora of possible outcomes, and to reveal \u201cno regret\u201d moves that should prove worthwhile under most scenarios.\n\nConsider CMS Energy, Michigan\u2019s largest electric and natural gas utility. A decade ago the company\u2019s leaders recognized that the fundamentals of its business were changing rapidly. CMS was facing a dynamic regulatory environment; the emergence of new generation and distribution technologies; changes in the supply and cost of critical inputs for coal, gas, and nuclear power; and evolving market conditions that affected the demand for electricity locally and nationwide. Amid this uncertainty CMS needed to determine which strategic investments to make and when to make them.\n\nHistorically the company had developed investment plans by carefully examining futures prices for coal and natural gas along with forecasts for future rates based on discussions with regulators. Had CMS stuck with that approach, it probably would have continued along its prior path\u2014investing incrementally in additional gas and electric capacity and waiting for changes in regulation or competition to threaten its profitability before altering course.\n\nBut CMS chose to employ a different model. Its leaders developed four extreme but plausible scenarios: deregulation (which envisioned a near-complete deregulation of the interstate electricity market); elimination of hub-and-spoke (which foresaw point-to-point flows of power across state lines); decarbonization (which anticipated a rapid increase in environmental regulations); and abundant gas (which built on the possibility that new sources would provide low-cost natural gas to the U.S. market). None of those scenarios was viewed as likely. Rather, they represented outcomes that the company might face, each with a very different impact on CMS\u2019s core utility business.\n\nUsing an analysis of the company\u2019s position under each of the four scenarios, the executive leadership team identified several no-regret moves, such as deleveraging CMS\u2019s balance sheet, improving customer advocacy to help manage regulatory risk, and finding ways to reduce the costs of fuel and purchased power. Those actions would be valuable under all four scenarios. Leaders also saw the potential to reconfigure the company\u2019s generation portfolio according to the availability and cost of natural gas balanced against pressures for decarbonization. As important, CMS discovered that its traditional strategy of incrementally adding capacity was risky under all four scenarios: It would leave the company vulnerable to assault by regulators and competitors and behind potential changes in the market for electrical power. In fact, no one anticipated at the time that natural gas prices would fall some 67% in 2014, but that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nInvesting in strategic hedges and options is not the same as placing a bet on every square. Juggling competing bets dilutes leadership focus and squanders scarce talent.\n\nBecause leadership had identified extreme but plausible scenarios as opposed to most-likely scenarios, the company was better placed than competitors to switch generation from coal to gas quickly, which put CMS Energy in the top decile of utilities in terms of shareholder returns from 2015 to 2020.", "len": 757}, {"value": "The fourth step is\n4. Identify Trigger Points, Signposts, and Metrics\nThe value of an option depends a lot on when it is exercised. In sectors where the winner takes most of the future profit pool, moving ahead of the competition can lead to enormous advantages. Consider Uber and Lyft. Uber accepted its first rider just 18 months before Lyft did, but that brief head start enabled it to build a sizable lead, with a 70% share of riders; Lyft has been confined to a 30% market share ever since. Even in markets where first-mover advantages are far less, knowing when to move is important. Accordingly, leading companies identify trigger points, signposts, and metrics to help them spot changes before the competition does and capitalize on the flexibility embedded in their strategies.\n\nA leading automotive original-equipment manufacturer (OEM), for example, identified the penetration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as a critical factor, or trigger point, affecting most elements of its strategy\u2014from the investments the company should make in traditional internal-combustion engine (ICE) technology to the size of its dealer network to its long-term governance and operating model. At the time, forecasts for BEV penetration varied widely, from less than 20% of worldwide vehicle demand by 2030 to greater than 50%. The manufacturer\u2019s leaders developed several extreme but plausible scenarios and decided to shrink the company\u2019s ICE footprint and investment plans consistent with a 30% penetration of BEVs by 2030.\n\nHowever, management recognized that this planned reduction could prove insufficient if BEV penetration were to accelerate. So it identified some leading indicators, or signposts, to monitor BEV penetration\u2014for example, government regulatory announcements, manufacturers\u2019 BEV commitments, BEV competitor production guidance to investors, BEV battery costs and trajectory down the cost/experience curve, and observed penetration rates by geography\u2014with explicit metrics for each. It identified trigger points, signposts, and metrics for six other factors as well.\n\nThe specificity of these was critical, enabling the manufacturer\u2019s leaders to remain vigilant, poised to alter course at the first sign of a significant change in the market\u2019s trajectory. The company tracks metrics tied to each important signpost quarterly. The senior executive team agreed that if the signposts indicated that BEV penetration would hit 30% by 2028, the company should shorten its shift from ICE to BEV manufacturing by four years. By thinking through potential course changes in advance, leaders could exercise their options to best effect, taking full advantage of the flexibility associated with waiting to act with the benefit of additional information while maximizing the value of their profitable ICE business as long as was practical.\n\nLeaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question should be not \u201cHow did we perform?\u201d but \u201cShould we alter course?\u201d\n\nSignposts and trigger points are never static. By design, they reflect management\u2019s best understanding of the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d affecting a company\u2019s strategy at a particular point in time. As more \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d become known, signposts and trigger points must be revised and refined. For example, Netflix may not have identified Disney\u2019s acquisition of BAMTech as a signpost in advance. But it had to respond or risk losing its dominant position. Likewise, prior to January 2022 very few (if any) companies we know of had specified signposts tied to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The few companies that quickly incorporated that event into their strategy were better positioned than competitors to keep employees safe and the business on a stable footing.\n\nStrategy must respond to unanticipated changes in market and competitive conditions. Accordingly, when those conditions abruptly change, leaders must quickly revise the trigger points and signposts they are tracking, following the same process they used to establish the initial metrics. The more up-to-date a company\u2019s signposts, the better the odds of executing a successful response to external shocks.", "len": 789}, {"value": "In addition David J. Collis also adds\nThe Complete Strategy Landscape. Strategy involves more than finding an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. It requires an aligned set of choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success. The entire set of strategic decisions comprises these questions: One: What is our opportunity set? What demographic, political, technological, regulatory, and other environmental changes can we exploit? Two: How can we create the most value? What is our business model? What\u2019s the \u201cjob to be done\u201d for customers? How will we charge for our product or service? What assets do we need to produce and deliver it? Three: How can we capture value? Does the industry structure allow a decent return? What is our positioning? What is the scope of our business? What is its competitive advantage\u2014its unique value proposition and distinctive configuration of activities? How will our rivals react? Four: How do we keep realizing value over the long term? Will our initiatives build the capabilities we need in the long term? Are we organized to adapt to change? Five: How strong is the outcome? Does our performance provide us enough resources to support desirable future moves?\nThe second control mechanism lies in selection of the tactical projects pursued. Here, the CEO must be able to see through the fog of immediate pressures and identify and support a limited number of long-term initiatives that will guide the individual experiments. Typically, these become \u201ccorporate\u201d initiatives, even if in smaller firms nothing that fancy is ever announced. They\u2019re not objectives, since they lack a time frame and specific metrics, but broad themes that govern the sequence, selection, and design of multiple projects. They must be injected into every ongoing change program in the firm that cuts across silos and boundaries.\n\nThese broad initiatives should be manageable in number\u2014probably seven or fewer\u2014so that each can be adequately funded, monitored, and continually promoted. They cannot change regularly; if that happens, they\u2019ll be viewed as \u201cflavors of the month\u201d that can be ignored or met with lip service.\n\nCEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking?\n\nThese higher-level strategic programs must be owned and championed by the CEO. Only the firm\u2019s top leader has the perspective and authority to ensure there\u2019s enough investment in building the capabilities they\u2019ll require. One example is the \u201cdigitalization\u201d initiative at Siemens that Joe Kaeser spearheaded. Another is the Creating the New initiative at Adidas, which Herbert Hainer started and his successor, Kasper R\u00f8rsted, is continuing; it focuses on speed (in order to offer consumers \u201cexactly the products they want to buy whenever, wherever, and however they want to buy\u201d), key strategic cities (to spot emerging trends), and open-source innovation (collaborating with third parties in industry, sports, and entertainment). A third example is Bob Iger\u2019s commitment to invest in quality branded franchises, technology, and globalization during his 14 years at the helm of Walt Disney. Each CEO took personal responsibility for shepherding progress in the chosen areas.\n\nIt is the outcome of these \u201cmust-win\u201d battles that determines long-run success. Though these broad themes or initiatives are not corporate strategies\u2014as they are often mistakenly called\u2014their pursuit is an essential part of a complete strategy.", "len": 703}, {"value": "Fiji is an archipelago of more than 300 islands located in the Pacific Ocean.
