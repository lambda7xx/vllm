Week after week, month after month go by and you still are no farther ahead of the game\u2026stuck in the status quo that never seems to change.\n\nBreaking free means that the status quo of your life has to change\u2026 your habits of expectation have to change \u2026your mindset has to change\u2026you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new mindset.\n\nYou have to be willing to shift your daily focus inwards towards what you need to do today rather than tomorrow. Because when you create a great day today you welcome in a more powerful tomorrow.\n\nWe all have the same 24 hours each day. But why are some people building fabulous careers, achieving healthy lifestyles, enjoying great relationships and incomes, living their passions, and creating what they truly desire as a life?\n\nImagine that you could clear away the distractions that you unconsciously create. You know the stuff that consumes your time causes stress and disconnects you from your purpose and passion. \n\nImagine every day you embrace the energy for what you are choosing to create in your life. Your thoughts empower you, your choices inspire you and your actions create momentum, opportunity and possibility.\n\nYou can create a GREAT LIFE, the life you want to live by focusing your efforts on Creating a Great Day Today. That\u2019s Day Sculpting. Seven intentional sculpted days turn into a month of wonderful weeks and a year of magnificent months creating an amazingly successful life.\n\nNone of this is going to work though if you believe that what you were born with is all you will get\u2026\n\nNo one will ever attempt to do something when they are convinced that they will fail.\n\nResearch has shown that the brain will actually stop itself from doing what\u2019s necessary to succeed if a person believes that they cannot succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s the small concrete indicators of success today that will prove you can have whatever it is you want and the process of Day Sculpting will empowers, inspire and motivates you each step of the way.\n\nYou see: Confidence + Discipline = Desired Outcomes \n\nIt\u2019s time to stop looking at your life from a fear based I don\u2019t know how to mindset but rather be open to creating a solutions focused change consciousness that embraces your gift and talents and encourages you sharing them.\n\nLet me share a bit of nuero-chemistry with you\u2026\nWhat fires together wires together\u2026\n\nSo rather than Fall back on old habits\u2026\nTake the transitional step\u2026of being fully present to whats trying emerge as your ideal future and to help it along start building confidence each day\u2026\n\nAnd your possibility muscle and an intended thought process that leads to a more focused and clear out picturing of your desires.\n\nYou see...It\u2019s one thing to set goals and to make to do lists and to say your going to use the law of attraction to manifest what you want in life\u2026\n\nI\u2019m still looking at the many lists I have created.\n\nWhat it\u2019s really about is having a clear and purposeful intention in order to create the energy and the MindState Of success that will propel you into action.\n----\n\nWhen done ask me for part 2", "len": 2376}, {"value": "Here is part 2\n\n-----\nWhat I have found is the easiest way to have a great day is by knowing what direction you are headed in and then taking what we call success steps small incremental and measurable steps on a daily basis. \n\nI teach a process called What\u2019s Different designed to maximize your efforts by eliminating external circumstances that block your path to achieving your chief aims\u2026I encourage you to use it on a daily basis\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s how it works\u2026Before you commit to a course of action IDENTIFY with the internal energy you want to mirror in your outer reality\u2026VISUALIZE the outcome that you are seeking\u2026IMAGINE what it will feel like when you realize the outcome\u2026REMEMBER what didn\u2019t work before Commit to a new way of seeing your actions and ANCHOR that memory by creating a new belief. \n\nThe status quo of your life has to change\u2026the habits of expecting how things have to go has to change \u2026your mindset has to change\u2026you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new possibility paradigm.\n\nWe call this living from momentum mindsets\u2026so that you begin to see what\u2019s possible rather than what\u2019s not.\n\nMomentum Mindsets are mindsets that encourage you to take risks, to discover your passions and to live from your adventurous spirit. It\u2019s a mindset that empowers you to know that you were born with an innate drive to have what you want in life rather than accepting something that is less than your true calling. \n\nYou have to be inspired in what your building towards in your life and this to has happen each day\u2026 in every moment\u2026 it\u2019s never about how busy you can be but rather how not to get ahead\u2026and to stay focused on the moment your in.\n\nBe present to what you to do today not tomorrow so the momentum you build upon will make your task tomorrow that much easier. \n\nI use a simple formula\u2026\nIntention\u2026creates attention\u2026causing momentum\u2026resulting in desired outcomes.\n\nPeople who have achieve great success in life simply think differently and you can think like them. Successful people have a disciplined approach to their day. They know what their next step will be. They are always in a solutions oriented mindset.\n\nI believe there are two kinds of mindsets\u2026\n\nFixed Mindset\u2026fixed resources\u2026fixed outcomes\u2026fixed thinking\nGrowth Mindset\u2026Momentum Mindsets are growth mindsets\n\nIt\u2019s important to have:A daily ritual that you can follow\u2026creating repetition and new mind muscle memory and a plan that will get you there\u2026\n\nDay Sculpting uses the latest innovations in the psychology of being successful, how the brain works to empower you and what it means to have a support system on a daily basis that will enable you to create powerful, productive and successful days.\n\nWhat we know about creating success is how important\u2026.in fact how it is a game changer\u2026 that you live your life one day at a time. When you do you are more present and available to what\u2019s seeking to emerge. You are less likely to get ahead of yourself and more likely to be fully present.\n\nIt is important to set intentions everyday so that you are always in the energy of creating your day the way you want it to play out.\n\nIt is important to understand the concept of Competing Commitments and how you can really learn how to streamline your day by being in the energy of what you want and being able to notice the distractions that have been habitual life stoppers so you can create a success oriented MindState.\n\nAnd how to specifically understand how neuro-chemistry can build new neuro pathways to support you in reaching your chief aims. And just what isThe Master Formula Of Attainment that\u2019s been understood for hundreds of years and how this works in your life.\n\nAn outcome for you when U experience DaySculpting is that you create Momentum Mindsets that inspire, encourage and empower you to take small steps each day to prove you can live the life you truly desire as you create new habits and new possibilities for you.\n\nRather than think you have to do it all at once when you take small manageable success steps that momentum build s momentum that empowers you to keep moving forward\u2026what we call forward momentum\u2026\n\nIn order to connect on a mental and emotional level to what you really want to create in your life you first have to clear out the sabotaging information and thoughts that are competing for your time and energy.\n\nWhen you Quiet The Mind from your Mrnytal MindTrap Chatter\u2026You clear a path for your intuition and inner wisdom to show up and guide you. You become a participant and not a spectator in your life and the flow of your creative energy is freed from old habits and conditioning. \n\nThe next concept we share is called The Law Of Reinforcement. What this means is that the more you do something and get a positive response the more likely you will continue to do that behavior.\n\nWe are always making choices and getting feedback. What if you were able to condition your mind and emotions to consistently choose what supports nurtures and empowers you each day? Wouldn\u2019t you be more likely to continue in those behaviors? \n\nThat\u2019s a key part of Day Sculpting\u2026Repetition, Positive Conditioning, Disciplined Actions and Increased Resiliency puts you in alignment and harmony with your highest purpose and your desired results follow.\n\nStudies have shown that most adult learners tend to give up after 3 tries to learn something new. And it takes a minimum of 10 tries before you believe it\u2019s something you can do. And then it takes 50 tries to get good at it. \nIt\u2019s not about a quick fix it\u2019s about building and sculpting your daily muscle of success and that takes time and work\u2026\n\nHow we relate to our potential future. Most people when they think about a future goal see the challenges, the obstacles, the gap between where they are now and where they would rather be. The mind then projects into that gap a sense of lack, limitation and fear that they might not be able to achieve it.\n\nThe result is that for most people the future is a place of uncertainty but for us the future is the fertile unknown, a place of emerging possibility. Our job is to connect into the pure creative imaginal realm that we were all born into when we came into this world.\n\nPeople who have created great works in the world had a special relationship with the pure imaginal realm. Edison, Einstein, Great Artists and Philosophers, leaders like MLK, Ghandi, and Mother Teresa. They were all bringing through them what was trying to emerge in the world.\n\nIn Day Sculpting we call this Future Pacing.\n\nWe talk about The Positive Feedback Loop\u2026This is a cool concept and vitally important in Day Sculpting. With a Positive Feedback Loop you are always noticing what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.\n\nWhen something isn\u2019t working that\u2019s feedback that lets you know you need to stop doing it and do something different. When something is working, that\u2019s feedback that lets you know to keep doing more of it.\n\nAs you choose to follow the path the feedback gives you, you are continuously being guided towards your desired destination by forces that support your desire. It\u2019s like the game warmer warmer, hotter hotter.\n\nThe Positive Feedback Loop naturally clears out old habits, feelings of uncertainty, and competing commitments replacing them with a new mindset based around positive, inspired and successful choices that produce what it is you want in life.\n\nThe reason that this concept is so powerful can be understood by what we know about brain science. We know we have 2 very distinct brains inside of us. One is like the ultra rational scientist. It knows what\u2019s best for you and what you should be doing to make your life work. The other brain is like a Neanderthal and its only looking for immediate gratification, comfort and safety.\n\nThe part of your brain that switches between these two is called the Reticular Activating System. I\u2019ll just call it RAS.\nThe RAS is constantly bringing your attention to what\u2019s most important. When a competing commitment shows up the RAS needs to switch you to focus on what you truly desire, not just the distraction of short term gratification that causes you to avoid the greater success that your now ready to enjoy.\n\nThat\u2019s what Day Sculpting does naturally. It trains the Reticular Activating System, so that day by day, week by week, and month by month, you create the life you truly desire to live.\nSOME MORE STUFF FOR U MIKE\u2026\n\nIn our previous videos, we shared with you the principles of the positive feedback loop, the Master Formula of Attainment, Competing Commitments, Law of Reinforcement, the concept of Connecting, Momentum Mindsets in which intention creates attention causing momentum and desired outcomes, the concrete indicators of success, the reticular activating system, growth and fixed mindsets, repetition, positive conditioning, disciplined actions, and increased resiliency, future pacing, and overcoming our built in immunity to change.\n\n---\nwhen done ask me for the final part, part 3", "len": 1838}, {"value": "Here is the final part. Part 3\n---\n\nHere we will be showing how the principles and practices we\u2019ve covered so far converge into one over-arching result that will benefit you for the rest of your life. You can think of it as flipping a switch that changes how you create new results in life one day at a time. This is at the very core of what we call Day Sculpting. \nThe simplest way to think of it is that most of the way we live is habitual. You have an habitual way of brushing your teeth, walking, talking to yourself and others, eating, working. Habits are wonderful\u2026they make life easy but they also limit you. For example, if you have a habit of eating too much, you\u2019ll put on weight. Not instantly, but steadily, day by day, until one day you have a weight problem. If you try to change your weight quickly through a trendy new diet, research shows that the weight is likely to come back, and then some, within a few short months, because the habits required to live at your ideal weight have not been properly established. \nHabits are habits because you don\u2019t think about them, they happen nonconsciously. If you want a change in your life, you have to embody the change at a nonconscious level, so that the habits keeping your life the way it is today begin to shift.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a switch in the brain that would move you from status quo to status GO!? This is a switch that once you flip it will produce the result you want, if you are willing to commit to and stay with the process.Day Sculpting is your guide to fully realizing the success you are ready to enjoy.\nA critically important capacity of the human mind called preconscious processing. This is the ability of the mind to receive information, beneath our conscious awareness, and act upon it without even knowing that it is happening. Used correctly, this is an amazing power. Used improperly, it will sabotage your best efforts and make life extremely difficult.\nMost of us think we are running the show with our conscious awareness, consciously choosing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and consequently, we believe are able to choose the results we create in life. However, what neuro-science research shows, is that we all have a vast nonconscious mind that is really running the show most of the time. That deeper part of us, in charge of our habitual thinking, feeling, and behaving is always operating in our best interest. But it does so using information that may be faulty or outdated. If you continue to feed it information that doesn\u2019t serve you, it will continue to habitually bring results that are less than desired.\nYour preconscious processor is constantly routing new information directly into this larger database that your mind uses to create new behaviors. Your job is to place the right information into this database every single day, so that it can draw upon this new data and create new results. It requires your vigilance and purposeful intention on a daily basis. Day Sculpting is the process to accomplish exactly that, getting you to focus one day at a time on what you are trying to create in your life today, and the future you truly desire. \nA lot of experts in the human development field teach information and then expect it will translate into new behaviors automatically. But as we\u2019ve pointed out, and as you\u2019ve probably experienced, consciously knowing something and having the nonconscious mind put it into a new behavior, are two entirely different processes. What we are sharing with you is how to bridge that gap. This is precisely why so many experts in the field are recommending Day Sculpting to their clients, to help them use momentum mindsets on a daily basis and apply the good information they teach. \nWe talk about The The Solutions Focus process . Try it out: \nThink of an area of your life in which you are actively attempting to create different results. Imagine your chief aim regarding this area of your life as a perfect future. Now imagine a scale from one to ten, where ten is the perfect future and one is that you have not even started thinking about your chief aim. On this imaginary scale from 1 to 10, where would you place yourself right now?\nGo ahead and imagine where would you place yourself right now on that scale, where ten is your perfect future.\nWhatever number you came up with is fine. Whether it was 3 or 7, whatever you came up with I\u2019ll always ask the same next question. \u201cWhy so high and not lower?\u201d\nLet\u2019s say, for example that you came up with a three. Asking the question \u201cWhy so High\u201d catches the mind off guard. Most people expect, \u201cOnly a 3! Why so low?\u201d If I had asked that what would you come up with? All the reasons why things aren\u2019t working, who is to blame, problems, excuses, lack, limitations, and so on. \nBut when I ask \u201cWhy so high?\u201d the brain immediately begins to sort for all of the things that are working for you, everything that has brought you up to a \u201cthree.\u201d If you said you are at a seven on a scale of one to ten, the same question applies: \u201cWhy so high and not lower?\u201d\nThe next step in solutions focus is equally powerful. \u201cThink about what you can do today to move you one point up that scale\u2014for example, from a three to a four, or from a seven to an eight?\u201d When you ask this, your mind instantaneously starts generating ideas and options to answer your question. You quickly realize you can do more of the things that work, right? And if you are doing things that aren\u2019t working, you now have the insight into how you can do things differently. \nThis solutions focus approach provides quick insight into how to move things forward in areas you may have been stuck or working on unsuccessfully. It is a brilliant way to access more of your nonconscious database and facilitate discovering resources you did not know were there. \nSo as you can see, this video has been centered on connecting the dots and providing you with the insights on how you can flip the switch in your brain and how you can create your life one day at a time in the most powerful way possible. \nYou must contact that inner part of you that is in charge of your habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in order to re-sculpt yourself.\nThis is a unique psychological principle called anchoring. In the research this is also called behavioral conditioning, and as we\u2019ve called it, the law of reinforcement\u2026which says you get more of what you reinforce. When you want to reinforce a positive new behavior, you anchor it in a positive new momentum mindset. As you do this on a daily basis, you are literally training your mind, conditioning your thoughts, amplifying positive feelings and emotions to live into a future state that you are anchoring in your daily experience. \nDay Sculpting goes beyond personal development. It takes whatever it is you are currently learning and makes it possible for you to embody, apply and enjoy the benefits you are committed to achieve. \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is more stuff to do. What we need is that everything we do gets us the results we are going for. In essence what\u2019s needed is a system that will streamline our efforts so we accomplish our chief aims in less time.\n\nMichaelangelo said the process of sculpting is to remove what\u2019s not supposed to be there. He had the mindset that the finished sculpture already existed in the marble and he just had to reveal it. In the same way your destiny already resides in you. You just need to clear a path for it to emerge.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. So why do some people consistently have great days while others are up and down and stay stuck in mediocrity? It\u2019s a disciplined habit of how you approach everyday. Day Sculpting takes the same 24 hours that we all have and helps clarify your choices so that your actions reveal your highest destiny. \n\nIt is a quick, easy and effortless way that supports and empowers your efforts in achieving your chief aims. It creates the mindsets necessary to have successful days, weeks, months and years.\n\nDay Sculpting is a 90- day program designed to empower you to create your life ONE DAY AT A TIME. By committing 30 minutes each day to create what you want that day. \n\nWe believe that when you focus your actions one day at a time the results you get become measurable and achievable. Your energy is committed to channeling your efforts so you create a confident groove in your mind that empowers your habitual actions to create what you really want.\n\nThis daily program is broken down into 3 MANAGEABLE, SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS. 15 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes midday and 10 minutes at night. \n\nDay Sculpting\u2026It\u2019s designed so that the way you start your day creates the momentum that carries you throughout your day. \n\nAnd finally research has shown that the best time to integrate what you\u2019ve learned in your day and to set yourself up for success tomorrow is before you go to sleep. The Nighttime Review process takes just 10 minutes, which is less time then it takes to take a shower or to take your dog on an evening walk.\n\nWe already have enough complexity in life\u2026don\u2019t we? We don\u2019t want you working harder we want you thinking smarter! So that the success you achieve is more effortless. \n\nSo what does it take for someone to accomplish the high level results we are talking about?\n\n\u2022 First you have to wake up and be totally jazzed about the day\n\u2022 You have to be inspired to do your best\n\u2022 You have to be focused on creating what you truly desire\n\u2022 You got to get to it, stay on it, and be in the energy of it before your distractions take over. \n\u2022 And if distractions takeover you have to quickly get back on track.\n\u2022 You have to learn from what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not\n\u2022 You have to be able to listen to feedback and course correct during your day\n\u2022 And at the end of the day you have be able to feel you did your best and you can do even better tomorrow\n\nAnd with Day Sculpting you can accomplish this and more in less than 30 minutes which is distributed throughout your day. Most people will give up on their dreams after they have tried something only 3 times because they didn\u2019t get instant gratification. \n\nThere are no magic bullets here. You are investing in a future YOU desire. \n\nDay Sculpting gives you the opportunity everyday to purposefully stay in the energy of what you want to create the benefit to you being a more empowered mindset that inspires passionate action and a willingness to breakthrough any barriers that may have held you back in the past so you fully embody the life you choose to live.\n\nYou may have heard Gandhi say \u201cBe the change you want to see in the world.\u201d Well now you can. \n\nYears ago I heard a statistic that blew me away.

The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples\u2019 psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users\u2019 psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals\u2019 social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one\u2019s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users\u2014humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people\u2019s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users\u2019 psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people\u2019s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users\u2019 holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology and a holistic profiling approach.\n\nPsychological profiling in the wild. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed psychological profiling methodology through a use case. We identify a set of Twitter users who seem to be accepted as opinion leaders on social media (i.e., have a large following). We apply our methodology to predict their psychological profiles and analyze results. We find that the distributions of traits significantly deviates from regular users (defined as users included in our ground-truth dataset), and that the set of leaders can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles. These findings highlight the usefulness of our approach in the characterization of the personalities for different groups of OSN users (e.g., such a group psychological profile could be used to recommend skills/activities/jobs to users based on their profile similarity) and classification of users based on their profiles.\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of related psychological literature, discuss related work, and highlight several open issues of existing methods. We also highlight the contribution of the present work. Section 3 details the collected dataset and the data mining and feature engineering methodology, and Section 4 presents the design and evaluation of the proposed machine learning predictive model. Finally, we conclude our article and discuss future work in Section 6.\n\nFirst, Please Summarize the paper in 10 points, in easy to read and understand simple English.\nSecond, Explain what the paper does as if I'm 11 years old.\n\nThanks :))", "len": 1988}, {"value": "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company\u2019s or agency\u2019s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n\u2022 Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO\u2019s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n\u2022 Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn\u2019t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors\u2019 Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n\u2022 Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company\u2019s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public\u2019s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can \u201csnow\u201d the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it\u2019s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as \u201ca reliable source.\u201d Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: \u201cAcme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.\u201d\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: \u201cAcme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, \u2018Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors\u2019 in endurance, quality, and safety; it\u2019s also available at a lower\nprice.\u2019 \u201d\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n\u201cIn repeated tests against our competitors . . . \u201d\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you\u2019ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who\u2019s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there\u2019s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance\u2014press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies\u2014that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don\u2019t know, say, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave that information at the moment, but I\u2019ll get it to you as soon as I do\u201d\u2014\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you\u2019re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They\u2019ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don\u2019t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point. Rambling and repetition\nare likely to get you into trouble or open new lines of inquiry.\ni.

Always speak as \"I\" and never as \"we\".\nMy first real teamwork experience was during my first year of engineering school, where I lead as a project leader an open project, aiming to sensibilize people to food's waste. I was managing a group of 7 people, and doing plannification. I was confronted to the difficulties of the management and ressource allowance, and this really gave me the desire to lead teams later on. The project was a real success as I managed to adapt threw the covid crises and meet my objectives.\nMy second real experience was during my first internship, at the year of my first year of engineering school. I worked at Nyrstar, and i was in charge of analyzing the processes and data, make dashboards, in order to optimize the process. The final goal of this internship was to be able to monitor, understand and control the temperatures of the process. It was a factory producing huge quantities of zinc, and I took my time to analyze the environnement and the available data. I succed at my mission as we were able to reduce the average temperature by 1\u00b0 thanks to my actions. Reducing the temperature permit to produce more and therefore to make more money. I made my own routine collecting data as nothing was in place, and after some time making sense with my environnement I was able to make a complete system collecting, extracting and treating data. Dashboards were only made with Excel and Uniformance. I think my main achievement during this internship was to make more with less as I didnt have ressources available. i always found ways to do better with what I had, and i was able to provide meaningful recommendations to keep the temperature low. Many of the reporting tools I've deployed are still used nowadays and helped them surviving the energy crisis as temperature management became even more an issue for them. This internship lasted 3 months.\nMy next serious work experience was at Enedis, during my second year of engineering school. I was in charge of completely redesigning the reporting system and make a visual management system for the support service of Enedis. It was an highly eniriching experience for me, as I was in complete autonomy and no one had technical skills in my filed in the service. I had actually to make everything from scratch as they only had excel directly copied from exports. My first mission was to make the dashboard for the intern client, on half of the activity. It was actually my inital mission, but I achieved after spending 4 full days meeting and understanding the need of the customers, I was able to come up with a solutions that suits every stakeholders by providing optimized VBA dashboards with visual management in a week only. It took then several week to implement additionnal features and ajust the dashboard so it was ready to be used. I had no skills in VBA and I quickly learnt thanks to my proficiency in SQL, ETL and python. i was able in a month to basically do what I wanted in VBA, and deliver results quick. I really cared about the customer experience during my whole internship and i've been sending surveys to know theirs thought about the tools I was delivering them. i went from 56% satisfaction at the beginning of my internship to 78% at the end (on 99 regional managers). I was able to complete my mission way ahead of my time, and I was in charge to generalize the reporting tools and automated tools to the whole country, including the other activity, and the service that was in south of france (the division where I was working in was split in half). The responsibilities of the project totaly overcame what was defined but that was completely fine as I had the opportunity to do weekly meeting with the TOP 3 of Enedis so we could discuss changes and new way to do things. I even automated certains tools, including one that lead to save more than $50k per year in manpower. I started projects on my own too, such as a simple VBA excel file that was allowing my coworkers to calculated theirs CO2 consumption depending on their mode of transport and the distance.\nI was in charge of making the dashboards for the intern performances of my coworker too, and I automated the file that was used to affect the work load. I hugely contributed to improve process and reduce wastes, and I really loved the direct impact that I had threw my data analysis, my business recommendations and that i had to adapt to a complex environnement. My responsibilites grew really fast as I was able to deliver in time, and I managed the workload during my whole internship even if deadlines were shorts. i achieved a lot of project on my own thanks to the autonomy granted and the trust given. i learnt a lot from my mistakes during this internship, both technically and humanely. Dealing with a lot of different stakeholders was a very intersting experience as I realized it would become one of the most important aspect of my work. I really felt that I could make a big impact threw my professional life during this internship by combining my technical and analytical skills to my soft skills.

Always speak as \"I\" and never as \"we\".\nMy first real teamwork experience was during my first year of engineering school, where I lead as a project leader an open project, aiming to sensibilize people to food's waste. I was managing a group of 7 people, and doing plannification. I was confronted to the difficulties of the management and ressource allowance, and this really gave me the desire to lead teams later on. The project was a real success as I managed to adapt threw the covid crises and meet my objectives.\nMy second real experience was during my first internship, at the year of my first year of engineering school. I worked at Nyrstar, and i was in charge of analyzing the processes and data, make dashboards, in order to optimize the process. The final goal of this internship was to be able to monitor, understand and control the temperatures of the process. It was a factory producing huge quantities of zinc, and I took my time to analyze the environnement and the available data. I succed at my mission as we were able to reduce the average temperature by 1\u00b0 thanks to my actions. Reducing the temperature permit to produce more and therefore to make more money. I made my own routine collecting data as nothing was in place, and after some time making sense with my environnement I was able to make a complete system collecting, extracting and treating data. Dashboards were only made with Excel and Uniformance. I think my main achievement during this internship was to make more with less as I didnt have ressources available. i always found ways to do better with what I had, and i was able to provide meaningful recommendations to keep the temperature low. Many of the reporting tools I've deployed are still used nowadays and helped them surviving the energy crisis as temperature management became even more an issue for them. This internship lasted 3 months.\nMy next serious work experience was at Enedis, during my second year of engineering school. I was in charge of completely redesigning the reporting system and make a visual management system for the support service of Enedis. It was an highly eniriching experience for me, as I was in complete autonomy and no one had technical skills in my filed in the service. I had actually to make everything from scratch as they only had excel directly copied from exports. My first mission was to make the dashboard for the intern client, on half of the activity. It was actually my inital mission, but I achieved after spending 4 full days meeting and understanding the need of the customers, I was able to come up with a solutions that suits every stakeholders by providing optimized VBA dashboards with visual management in a week only. It took then several week to implement additionnal features and ajust the dashboard so it was ready to be used. I had no skills in VBA and I quickly learnt thanks to my proficiency in SQL, ETL and python. i was able in a month to basically do what I wanted in VBA, and deliver results quick. I really cared about the customer experience during my whole internship and i've been sending surveys to know theirs thought about the tools I was delivering them. i went from 56% satisfaction at the beginning of my internship to 78% at the end (on 99 regional managers). I was able to complete my mission way ahead of my time, and I was in charge to generalize the reporting tools and automated tools to the whole country, including the other activity, and the service that was in south of france (the division where I was working in was split in half). The responsibilities of the project totaly overcame what was defined but that was completely fine as I had the opportunity to do weekly meeting with the TOP 3 of Enedis so we could discuss changes and new way to do things. I even automated certains tools, including one that lead to save more than $50k per year in manpower. I started projects on my own too, such as a simple VBA excel file that was allowing my coworkers to calculated theirs CO2 consumption depending on their mode of transport and the distance.\nI was in charge of making the dashboards for the intern performances of my coworker too, and I automated the file that was used to affect the work load. I hugely contributed to improve process and reduce wastes, and I really loved the direct impact that I had threw my data analysis, my business recommendations and that i had to adapt to a complex environnement. My responsibilites grew really fast as I was able to deliver in time, and I managed the workload during my whole internship even if deadlines were shorts. i achieved a lot of project on my own thanks to the autonomy granted and the trust given. i learnt a lot from my mistakes during this internship, both technically and humanely. Dealing with a lot of different stakeholders was a very intersting experience as I realized it would become one of the most important aspect of my work. I really felt that I could make a big impact threw my professional life during this internship by combining my technical and analytical skills to my soft skills. I've allowed Enedis to save a lot of money and gave them completed and documented tools. I always do things with passion, and i strive to do better, to find best way of thinking or doing stuff.\n\n\u2003\n\nUse only really short sentences or keywords, and add a title for each story.

Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album\u2019s title refers to the \u201caubade\u201d, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n\nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a \u201cfruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.\u201d Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\ncredits\nreleased February 4, 2022\n\n \n\n \n\nMKX\\_300dpi\n\n \n\nCerys Weetch\n\nLabel / A&R Manager\n\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\n\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\n\nwww.mercurykx.com\n\n---", "len": 1608}, {"value": "Please read JMB's wikipedia: Jean-Michel Blais\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigationJump to search\nJean-Michel Blais\nBlais in 2018\nBlais in 2018\nBackground information\nBorn 1984 (age 37\u201338)\nOrigin Nicolet, Quebec, Canada\nGenres \nMinimalistavant-gardeneoclassical\nInstrument(s) Piano\nYears active 2015\u2013present\nLabels Arts & Crafts\nWebsite jeanmichelblais.com\nJean-Michel Blais (born 1984) is a composer and pianist from Quebec, Canada.\n\nHis music is influenced by a range of composers and pianists such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Maurice Ravel, classical minimalists (Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Erik Satie), and modern composers such as Chilly Gonzales and Yann Tiersen. English pop singer Ellie Goulding has cited Blais as an inspiration for her fourth album.[1]\n\nHis debut studio album Il was released in April 2016 on Arts & Crafts, garnering critical acclaim, including making Time magazine's top ten albums of the year list.[2] In 2017, he collaborated with Grammy-nominated English-Canadian electronic artist CFCF on the EP Cascades. His sophomore album, Dans ma main, was released on 11 May 2018, also on Arts & Crafts, and on 30 November 2018 Jean-Michel released Eviction Sessions.\nContents\n1 Early life\n2 Career\n2.1 2016: Il\n2.2 2017: Cascades\n2.3 2018: Dans ma main\n2.4 Eviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\n3 Discography\n4 References\n5 External links\nEarly life\nJean-Michel Blais grew up in the rural town of Nicolet, Quebec.[3] As a young boy, his parents influenced his love of music. While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a child, and his mother would play the organ.[4] Blais began his musical adventures by \"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio-Canada \"world\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\".[3]\n\nAs a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel.[4]\n\nHe travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage.[4] Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher.[5] He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level.\n\nCareer\n2016: Il\nWhile working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording.[4]\n\nIf people are going to cough and babies are going to cry, instead of trying to hide it, why not embrace it? I like it when I stop and there's something happening outside my window. I think that's why my music has a lot of pauses and silences, because there's always something happening in the street. I'll let it pass and then continue playing.\n\n\u2014\u2009Jean-Michel Blais in an interview with the Montreal Gazette[6]\nBlais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music.[7] Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on 8 April 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016.[8] The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine's Top 10 Albums of 2016.[2] Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\"[9]\n\n2017: Cascades\nMichael Silver (a.k.a. CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style.[10] Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage's In a Landscape (1948).\nI thought [Jean-Michel's music] was beautiful... I just loved it a bunch, especially because it's so different from a lot of the other piano music that I had tended to listen to...\n\n\u2014\u2009Michael Silver (CFCF)\nCascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end,\" and called the duo's version of \"In a Landscape\", \"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\".[11] Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver's chemistry, reasoning that \"Blais' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\" giving the album an 8/10.[12]\n\n2018: Dans ma main\nDans ma main is Blais' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on 11 May 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\".[13] On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF.\n\nBlais explained in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\".[14] The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[15] In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main.[16]\n\nEviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\nEviction Sessions is Blais' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on 30 November 2018. Eviction Sessions was inspired when Blais was informed he would be evicted from the apartment where he had lived for seven years due to gentrification within his Montreal neighbourhood. This was the same apartment in which Blais recorded his first album of instrumental music, Il. [1]\n\nIn October 2019, Blais released the soundtrack to the Canadian film Matthias & Maxime.
