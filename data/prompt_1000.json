[{"value": "Let's call these holding companies \"The Citadel Empire\". Use your understanding of the citadel empire to write a response to the following post: Hey Apes, Crux here.\n\nYou may remember my posts over the last year+ about the Citadel Empire, trying to untangle the spider web of companies Ken Griffin has created. I made ownership diagrams and did deep dives, trying to understand the why and how Citadel is structured.\n\nThere are endless rabbit holes and I had to put some boundaries on the project, so I simply started compiling a list of everything I have found.\n\nThat\u2019s all this post is: the list. Skip ahead if you want to see it.\n\nThere is no way this is all-inclusive.\n\nAlso, one of my first posts claimed Ken Griffin was a butterfly lover because I found a \u201cRed Admiral\u201d trust of his, which is a type of butterfly.\n\nSpoiler alert: Ken Griffin likes butterflies even more than I thought.\nr/Superstonk - The Citadel Empire, revealed: 500+ entities linked to Ken Griffin, all from public records. I have built the edge of the puzzle, can you help me fill in the middle? PS - Ken Griffin is still a butterfly lover\nBackground, and what this list is and isn\u2019t\n\nI reviewed thousands of public records from government regulators, corporate directories, county recorders, and property ownership databases to identify any evidence of business or assets (e.g. real estate) linked to Ken Griffin.\n\nThis list is basic. Each row contains four columns:\n\n An index number for reference;\n\n An entity\u2019s name;\n\n A source document/link and purpose for the entity, if I could determine it; and\n\n My hypothesis for what an entity\u2019s name means, as many are just combinations of letters.\n\nI have many more details, but didn\u2019t think it made sense to post all that right now. Ask if you want to see more on a particular entity, and please correct me if you see mistakes.\n\nI made sure to find evidence directly linking any of these entities to Griffin. Just because a business has \u201cCitadel\u201d in the name doesn\u2019t mean it is necessarily related to Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel.\n\nOf particular help were SEC filings and FINRA BrokerCheck and Form ADV reports - these self-disclosed affiliated companies and described the ownership structures. If you don\u2019t see a source for an entity in this list named \u201cCITADEL \u2026\u201d it is one of these, at one point I was just getting down as many names as I could.\n\nAnother source, the National Futures Association, has long lists of self-disclosed active and ceased \u201cpools\u201d (i.e. funds) run by Citadel Advisors (the hedge fund): https://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/basic-profile.aspx?nfaid=iRgkpH8tdFs%3D\n\nI used other links to identify these entities. Business addresses, signatures on documents from key lieutenants like Gerald Beeson and Steve Atkinson, and other \u201cenablers\u201d on documents like lawyers who exercised power of attorney for real estate transactions.\n\nBut this list won\u2019t include everything I\u2019ve found:\n\n I\u2019m not going to dive into details of Ken\u2019s family - where his kids, nieces and nephews, siblings, etc. reside, what schools they go to, their social media accounts, etc.\n\n I\u2019m not going to show you where his sister and brother-in-law\u2019s yacht is docked.\n\n I\u2019m not going to give you the VINs of the two (!) McLaren Senna GTR\u2019s he had shipped to the US.\n\n I\u2019m not going to give you the names of his nannies, property managers, family IT staff, etc.\n\nYou may find these things interesting, and they are leads I have followed, but they\u2019re not in the public interest. The focus here is Citadel, its eye-popping corporate structure, and the personal assets Ken Griffin is accumulating. A number of these assets have not been reported in the media. I believe there are many more entities than what I've compiled, especially overseas. My focus has mostly been US-based, as those are records I am familiar with.\nI can use your help:\n\n The entities highlighted yellow - I can link them to Ken Griffin, but I don\u2019t know their purpose. Do you know?\n\n I have found many companies scattered around the globe, and there must be more. What are they?\n\n Ken Griffin has spent an incredible amount of money on art. What entities hold it?\n\n Ken Griffin has donated hundreds of millions to universities, museums etc. I have only researched in detail his contributions to Harvard, which revealed a Cayman Island company through which the donation was made. What entities were used to make donations elsewhere?\n\n Ken Griffin is one of the biggest donors to US politics in recent years, as reported in the media. Are there other \u201cdark money\u201d contributions he has made, and how did he make them?\n\n A lot has been made by the media about how Ken Griffin spends his money, but who is giving Ken Griffin their money? Who are the pension funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, etc. that gave Citadel their money, and how much and when? Are there feeder funds that invest with Citadel and who operates them?", "len": 1058}, {"value": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"As per the Oxford Dictionary, a chatbot is defined as A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.

One good rule of thumb: When the other person gives\nyou an opening, pursue it, and build on your mutual experience.\nThis issue comes up even more in international communication. As companies\nfrom manufacturers to media conglomerates become increasingly global, managers\nneed to understand the norms of other cultures. Although English is on the verge of\nbecoming the international language, standards of behavior and social interaction\nvary greatly between the United States and England, let alone between, say, France\nand Japan. In one country an invitation to dinner may be considered an expected\npoliteness, while in another, it may be an invasion of a colleague\u2019s private time.\nAsking about someone\u2019s family may be absolutely required in one culture and offensively\nintrusive in another.\nNo textbook can cover all such contingencies; one good rule if you\u2019re not sure\nmay be the trial lawyer\u2019s: Don\u2019t ask a question to which you don\u2019t already know the\nanswer. Another, and sometimes contradictory, rule is: Be frank about your cultural\nconfusion. Your colleague likely will have been in the same situation himself and\nwill be happy to help out. Finally, do your research; you\u2019re likely to have a friend or\ncoworker who knows the terrain better than you do. Our purpose here is to sensitize\nmanagers to their increasing need to understand the norms of cultures other than\ntheir own. (For a case addressing the special features of international communication,\nsee International Oil later in this chapter.)\nThe opportunities for cultural confusion\u2014personal, commercial, ethical, and\nlinguistic\u2014are almost endless. Imagine marketing a Chevy Nova in Hispanic countries,\nwhere \u201cno va\u201d means \u201cit doesn\u2019t run.\u201d Many products that are perfectly safe to\nmarket in first-world countries raise ethical problems when sold in developing\ncountries\u2014infant baby formula, for example, which if mixed with contaminated\nwater can cause death. Working in other cultures means understanding your hosts\u2019\nconceptions of greetings, timing, hygiene, negotiation, agreement, politeness, personal\nspace, gesture, meal etiquette, and closure.\nWhile English has essentially become the international language, it\u2019s important\nto remember that there are many Englishes. A joke in one form of English can be a\ndeadly insult in another. Although it may seem too obvious to emphasize, you must\nunderstand the cultural norms and language use of people from other cultures before\nyou can communicate effectively with them. This is true even if they are, say,\nthe South American employees of your Canadian company. A bribe in one culture\ncan be a thoughtful gift in another.\nA recent article by Sydel Sokuvitz (Business Communication Quarterly, New\nYork, March, 2002) suggests some principles for conducting successful intercultural\nbusiness communication. Sokuvitz first describes the special challenges global\nmanagers face, including:\nCoping with a range of tensions that arise out of internationally dispersed activities,\nThe challenges of maintaining coordinated activities across time-zones, cultural\nboundaries, and different countries\u2019 laws, and\nThe difficulties posed when the right medium for your message in one culture\nmay be wrong in another.\nDrawing on a range of research in the field, Sokuvitz comes up with several\nprovocative conclusions:\nExcessive dependence on technological communication such as E-mail can result\nin problems for both communication and productivity.\nFace-to-face meetings with colleagues from other cultures are critical to achieving\neffective communication.\nStudying with students from other cultures is critical to preparing a manager\nfor working in the increasingly globalized economy.\nSokuvitz cites the following example from an article by Fernandez-Aroaz\n(\u201cHiring without Firing,\u201d Harvard Business Review, 1999):\nA U.S.-based telecommunications company was seeking a CEO for its new division\nin Latin America. An international search was conducted, and a veteran was\nhired, someone known as an effective manager and marketing expert. \u201cBut his run\nlasted less than a year and was nothing short of a disaster. The simple reason was\nthat he lacked the two skills that the job really required: negotiation and cross-cultural\nsensitivity.\u201d\nEventually the company was saved from near-bankruptcy by bringing in a\nnew CEO who was a native Latin American with work experience in the U.S. His\nability to bridge cultural differences is credited with saving the company.\nCommunications between headquarters and subsidiaries is only one example\nof the challenges posed by globalization. Companies in one country are under increasing\nsocial pressure to take responsibility for the behavior of their subcontractors\nin other countries. Recently, for example, Nike suffered adverse publicity because\nof the work practices of shoe manufacturers it employs in Asia.\nThe successful manager of the future increasingly will be required to be a citizen\nof the world. While electronic communication may work fine for conveying information\nor directions, there is no substitute for \u201cspeaking the language\u201d of the\npeople with whom you\u2019re trying to communicate.\n\nAre you ready to answer some questions on text 1, text 2 and text 3?", "len": 1082}, {"value": "Got it.\nYou can find me at the intersection of Business, Design, and Technology.\n\nI'm driven by curiosity. Ever since I was a child, I've been interested in how the things around me work. While this sometimes resulted in our Wi-Fi going out for hours because I would routinely experiment with different settings on the router, it's helped me realize that you must learn to fail in order to succeed.\n\nWith a background in e-commerce and hospitality, I've learned that people eat with their eyes first. I make it my mission to make businesses look as best as they can in front of their demographic. Especially now, a brand's digital presence determines its success in the market.

Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Sa\u00ebns' left hand \u00e9tudes religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n\n\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n\n\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's \u00e9tudes - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate \u00e9tudes to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire \u00e9tude for left hand solo.\n\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n\n\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n\n\n7. Diversions - Britten\n\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n\n\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n\n9. Six \u00e9tudes for the left hand - Saint-Sa\u00ebns\n\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Sa\u00ebns' piano \u00e9tudes are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano.", "len": 1022}, {"value": "Sure, here are the remaining equations related to our model:\n\nCapital returns:\n\nRkf=\u2202Yf\u2202Kf=\u03b1Af1\u2212\u03b1\u03b1(LfKf)\u03b2(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b1Rkg=\u2202Yg\u2202Kg=\u03b2Ag1\u2212\u03b2\u03b2(LgKg)(1\u2212\u03b2)(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b2Rkr=\u2202Yr\u2202Kr=Ar1\u03b1(LrKr)1\u2212\u03b1\u03b1R\\_k^f = \\frac{\\partial Y\\_f}{\\partial K\\_f} = \\alpha A\\_f^\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{L\\_f}{K\\_f}\\right)^\\frac{\\beta(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha} \\\\\nR\\_k^g = \\frac{\\partial Y\\_g}{\\partial K\\_g} = \\beta A\\_g^\\frac{1-\\beta}{\\beta} \\left(\\frac{L\\_g}{K\\_g}\\right)^\\frac{(1-\\beta)(1-\\alpha)}{\\beta} \\\\\nR\\_k^r = \\frac{\\partial Y\\_r}{\\partial K\\_r} = A\\_r^\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{L\\_r}{K\\_r}\\right)^\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\\\Rkf\u200b=\u2202Kf\u200b\u2202Yf\u200b\u200b=\u03b1Af\u03b11\u2212\u03b1\u200b\u200b(Kf\u200bLf\u200b\u200b)\u03b1\u03b2(1\u2212\u03b1)\u200bRkg\u200b=\u2202Kg\u200b\u2202Yg\u200b\u200b=\u03b2Ag\u03b21\u2212\u03b2\u200b\u200b(Kg\u200bLg\u200b\u200b)\u03b2(1\u2212\u03b2)(1\u2212\u03b1)\u200bRkr\u200b=\u2202Kr\u200b\u2202Yr\u200b\u200b=Ar\u03b11\u200b\u200b(Kr\u200bLr\u200b\u200b)\u03b11\u2212\u03b1\u200bOverall capital demand:\n\nK=Kf+Kg+KrK = K\\_f + K\\_g + K\\_r \\\\K=Kf\u200b+Kg\u200b+Kr\u200bOverall labor demand:\n\nL=Lf+Lg+LrL = L\\_f + L\\_g + L\\_r \\\\L=Lf\u200b+Lg\u200b+Lr\u200bOverall energy demand:\n\nE=Ef+EgE = E\\_f + E\\_g \\\\E=Ef\u200b+Eg\u200bDemand for goods outside the energy sector:\n\nQr=1\u03c0WrLrQ\\_r = \\frac{1}{\\pi} W\\_r L\\_r \\\\Qr\u200b=\u03c01\u200bWr\u200bLr\u200bReturns to investment in the different sectors:\n\nRf=\u03c0fKfRg=\u03c0gKgRr=\u03c0rKrR^f = \\frac{\\pi\\_f}{K\\_f} \\\\\nR^g = \\frac{\\pi\\_g}{K\\_g} \\\\\nR^r = \\frac{\\pi\\_r}{K\\_r} \\\\Rf=Kf\u200b\u03c0f\u200b\u200bRg=Kg\u200b\u03c0g\u200b\u200bRr=Kr\u200b\u03c0r\u200b\u200bDemand for fossil fuel energy:\n\nEf=(11+exp\u2061(\u2212\u03b3f(Wf\u2212W\u02c9f)))1\u03f5fEtE\\_f = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-\\gamma\\_f(W\\_f -
